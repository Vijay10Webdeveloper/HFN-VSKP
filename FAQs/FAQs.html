  <button class="collapsible">How should we meditate?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In Heartfulness meditation, we meditate upon the source of divine light within our heart. On its own, the source is so subtle that it is incomprehensible to us. Light from the source is the closest idea that we can have to take as our object. But there is no need to see any light. We can call it “light without luminosity.” Simply put, we meditate on the idea and not on the light.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">What is the Philosophy behind Heartfulness?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <li>The heart is pumping station of the blood and it supplies purified blood to all body cells, so the system takes heart as the object of meditation. “This way, we can set our individual mind on the right path. 
    <li>The heart is the only point at which the connecting link between the animate and the inanimate is clearly felt”. </li>
     <li> It is the field of action of our mind. </li>
     <li>Heart is the seat of Soul.</li>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">Why was meditation necessary for a physically healthy individual?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The nutritional needs differ for physical body (sthul sharir), our mind (sukshma sharir), and our soul (karan sharir). While the physical body is nourished through food, at a higher/ subtle level, we enrich our minds by education. For the soul, the scriptures say that one has to nourish one’s own prana with Divine energy. Due to grossness in thoughts and actions, we spoil our sense of discrimination & right cognition, but when one meditates, confusions disappear and one feels lightness.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">What was the Scientific rationale behind transmission?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Heartfulness uses the system of transmission and focuses on heart along with a method of cleaning taking care of an overall process of purity that weaves destiny through meditation. Heart is the seat of soul/life. If we focus on our heart and purify this. its effect will reach the entire body with the blood pumped.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">What is happening in us during Heartfulness Meditation?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In Heartfulness meditation we are evoking the subtlest notion of this deepest Self. The only way yogis over the centuries have been able to put that into words is to use the word ‘light’, as light has no apparent material qualities – you can’t touch it, or see it, or taste it or smell it or hear it. We do not take anything gross to meditate upon. In This meditation, we ask abhyasis to gently bring our attention to the Source of Light or Divine Light in the heart in meditation.
      We aim to experience a superfine and finer consciousness of this light within our hearts- “light without luminosity”. Just have the idea that there is Divine Light in your heart. The only way mystics and yogis over the centuries have been able to put that into words is to use the word ‘light’, as light has no apparent material qualities – you can’t touch it, or see it, or taste it or smell it or hear it. So we gently bring our attention to the Source of light/Divine Light.

  <button class="collapsible">Whether experience of all individuals are same or different?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Each person will have their own way of experiencing inner states, which become more recognizable as we become more familiar with meditating. Some people do not feel anything much, and that is normal and that is absolutely okay. Many notice changes in their daily lives and their behavior. Often, it is others around us who notice changes in us.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">What is the feedback from those who did Heartfulness?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>All those who practiced felt peaceful and energized after practicing relaxation and meditation. We have different programmes for universities, corporate & other groups. Meditation is constant remembrance. It is a complete thought. What happens when we dig a well? A lot of things come out before finding water. In meditation too, many things come to the surface before the essential thing is found. We require patience, without patience there will be no success.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">What do you mean by Masters? Who were they?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Masters are the guides and official presidents of the organization who gained mastery over their self. They help us in meditation through yogic transmission to attain the same state of self mastery. My master, Sri Ramchandra had started the Sahaj Marg seventy years ago and that practices go on.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">You insist on Group meditation. Is it necessary?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>When we meditate in a group. The effect of transmission increases due to a collection of energies from each soul/human being. Whole environment gets charged with positive energy and lightness percolates down on the entire assembly and at times, neighbors, too, experience emanating positive vibes.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">What is cleaning and how does it work?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Cleaning helps us in removal of thoughts and impressions. It also makes us feel lighter in our daily lives. Cleaning is needed to remove the thoughts that interfere with our meditation and cause grossness on ourselves Thoughts form impressions which later become habits and act as realms or interference when we try to connect with our higher self which is subtle, peaceful and silent.</p>
  </div> <hr>
  <button class="collapsible">Why do we need to get rid of thoughts?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Every thought or action performed with a feeling or consciousness of self leaves a trail of subtle impressions in the heart which become the seed for future thoughts and actions. When we meditate there is a delusion of our awareness. The thoughts/impressions that have accumulated and solidified over years find space to surface in our awareness. They tend to drop away after a while as we meditate and we gradually develop a state of thoughtlessness.</p>
